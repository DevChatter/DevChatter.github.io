Hi Chatters! Brendan here!

I just moved our site from being a static site built with wyam.io to to a static site built with [Statiq.dev](https://www.statiq.dev/) on GitHub Pages. I didn't migrate our existing site, but I instead built a fresh site. We hadn't finished the custom pipeline, so I figured I'd start that from scratch here. For those wondering, I run my [personal coding blog](https://brendoneus.com/) as a jekyll site on GitHub Pages, so I know a bit about that platform already.

I always love a chance to dig into some new technology, so I think no one will be surprised by this. Also, while DevChatter has never been exclusive to one tech stack, we tend to use a lot of C# and dotnet content, because it's one of my favorite languages and platforms for coding. With statiq.dev being a dotnet-based static site generator, it's worth having a look at.
