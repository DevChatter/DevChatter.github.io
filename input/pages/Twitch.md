# Stream Schedule

We used to have a constant weekly schedule of streams, but lately they happen when I have time. For that reason, I recommend turning on notifications, following me on Twitter and Mastodon, and joining the Discord.

Most streams are on weekday afternoons (US Eastern Time). We used to have a Saturday stream, but those are very rare anymore.
